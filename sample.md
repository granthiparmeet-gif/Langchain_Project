# Understanding Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems capable of autonomous decision-making, reasoning, and action.  
These agents can use tools, interact with APIs, and coordinate tasks with minimal human input.

## Key Components

- **LLMs (Large Language Models)** – Core reasoning engines.  
- **Memory** – Enables context retention across interactions.  
- **Tools & APIs** – Allow agents to perform real-world actions.  
- **Planning** – Helps the agent break down complex goals into sub-tasks.

## Example Use Cases

1. Automated research assistants  
2. AI-powered workflow automation  
3. Intelligent customer support bots  

### Summary

Agentic AI represents the next step in making AI truly *autonomous and useful*.
