  description: |
    Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way 
    with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line Interface Creation Kit".
    It's highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.
    It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun 
    while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.
